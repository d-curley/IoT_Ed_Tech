# IoT_Ed_Tech
Project Objective:  Design and implement a system to augment an existing engineering workshop for K-8 students.  In this challenge, students build assistive devices for a dog that has just received surgery on her back legs. I was hired to develop a high tech testing system that would make iteration more engaging and encourage more rapid prototyping in the students' design process.

Description: I designed 3 interactive testing stations, each measuring a design requirement that education researchers identified for the activity: time to take the device on and off, how well the device fits on the stuffed dog (force sensor), and how stable/supported the back legs are kept during device use (accelerometer).  Each station is controlled by an Arduino Nano 33 IoT microcontroller to collect the data and display it to users on an LCD screen.  This data is then sent to a Thingspeak server and graphed in MATLAB for students to see how their data compares to previous tests as well as the rest of class. I chose design requirements so that students could inform their design decisions with data but would not need to compromise agency in their problem selection. This technology is available for students at Tufts University to bring into local elementary school classrooms as a part of STOMP (https://sites.tufts.edu/stomp/).
